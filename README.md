# Bothive
Bothive is a project that I created to make it simpler for me to host Discord bots. It's simple, easy to use, and based off of Material Design 3. The project isn't 100% ready for use, but it's getting there.

## Installation
First, you'll need to clone the repo. Then, please run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies. Next, you can run `npm run build` to build the project. Finally, you can run `npm start` to start the project. The backend of this project isn't ready yet, so it's not fully functional.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute, please feel free to open a pull request. I'll review it as soon as I can. If you'd like to contribute to the backend, there will be a note in the README.md file when it's ready.
